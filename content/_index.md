title: "Welcome to Posit Open Source"
---

We build open source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication. Our tools are designed to help you do better work, whether you're analyzing data, building models, creating visualizations, or sharing insights.

## Our approach

We believe powerful data science tools should be open, accessible, and community-driven. That's why our core tools are free and open source, from RStudio IDE and the Tidyverse to Quarto and Positron. We're committed to supporting multiple languages and workflows, because your choice of tools should fit your work, not the other way around.
