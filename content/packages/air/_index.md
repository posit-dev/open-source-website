Air is an extremely fast R formatter that automatically styles your code. It works seamlessly with Positron and RStudio, formatting your code instantly when you save a file.

Air formats R code according to the tidyverse style guide, handling complex cases like pipe chains, function calls, and conditional statements. Built with Rust for maximum performance, Air can format large R files in milliseconds.
