Hi! I’m Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at Posit, where (among other things) I lead the [tidyverse]({{<ref "software/tidyverse" >}}) team. I build tools (computational and cognitive) that make data science easier, faster, and more fun. I’m from New Zealand but I currently live in Houston, TX with my husband and dogs.
