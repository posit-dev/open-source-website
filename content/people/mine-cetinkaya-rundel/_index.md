I am a Professor of the Practice and the Director of Undergraduate Studies at the Department of Statistical Science and an affiliated faculty in the Computational Media, Arts, and Cultures program at Duke University. I am also the Director of the First-Year Experience in Trinity College of Arts & Sciences. My work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education. I work on integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. In Fall 2025, I’m teaching STA 199 - Introduction to Data Science and Statistical Thinking. My office hours are Fridays 12:45-2:15 pm in Old Chem 211C.
