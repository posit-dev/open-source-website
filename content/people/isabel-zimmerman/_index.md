Hi there! I’m Isabel. I love creating things, whether that be making DIY crafts or open source tools. I’m keenly interested in making Python an easier and more fun place to do data science work.

I’ve spent time building Python packages like `vetiver` and `pins` as well as larger tools like the [Positron IDE]({{< ref "/packages/positron" >}}). My favorite type of work tends to be at the intersection of practical, user-facing tools and data science. I’m part of the pyOpenSci community, serving as an editor, reviewer, and Editor-in-Chief emeritus (Winter 2024 rotation). I enjoy sharing my work through blog posts and conference talks. I’ve also compiled a more in-depth list of my work.

Coding is a place for me to be whimsical and creative, but I tend to also do a lot of non-computer hobbies! I’m an avid reader, amateur book-binder, constant doodler (I drew my entire landing page!), and am always teaching my old dog new tricks.
