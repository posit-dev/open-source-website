ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics based on the Grammar of Graphics philosophy. Users provide data, map variables to aesthetics, specify graphical primitives, and the package handles visualization details.

With ggplot2, you can create complex, multi-layered graphics with minimal code, making it one of the most popular visualization packages in the R ecosystem.
