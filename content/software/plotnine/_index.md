Plotnine is a data visualization package for Python based on the grammar of graphics with syntax similar to ggplot2. It enables creation of publication-ready figures from ad-hoc plots with a consistent and intuitive API.

This project is funded by Posit (formerly RStudio), bringing the power of grammar of graphics to Python users.
