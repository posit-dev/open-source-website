dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help solve the most common data manipulation challenges. It offers functions for filtering, selecting, transforming, summarizing, and arranging data.

dplyr is designed to work naturally with data frames and works seamlessly with the pipe operator, making data transformation workflows intuitive and readable.
