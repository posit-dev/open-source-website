The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science that share underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. All packages work seamlessly together to make data analysis faster and easier.

The tidyverse package facilitates installing and loading core tidyverse packages with a single command, including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats.
