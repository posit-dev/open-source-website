Supported By Posit is a web component that package maintainers can add to their project websites to indicate Posit's support. The badge appears as a clickable element in the top navigation bar or mobile menu, linking to Posit's website.

The badge is easy to integrate by adding a single JavaScript file to Quarto and pkgdown websites. It supports customizable colors for light and dark modes, responsive behavior, and flexible positioning options to ensure it fits seamlessly into any site design.
